**"Inclusive and Participatory design oriented tool to sustain STEAM education".  Here is the overview**

•	The tool is hyper-personalised based on the learners Intelligence type (There are a total of 8 intelligence types - Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences)

•	Once the intelligence type is identified the learner has to upload their subject material (text book, handwritten notes, sample question paper, other relevant materials)

•	The LLM then proceeds to create a visual output in a storyline format with the learner embedded in the learning experience

•	The tool also creates assessments to ensure spaced repetition based on scoring patterns, forgetting curve, and aims to be scaled up (beyond 15 year olds at both ends of the spectrum) based on John Piaget's theory of cognitive development

•	Intends to develop a healthy and sustained curiosity for STEAM subjects among girls/women by integrating women with noteworthy contributions to society as role models in the narrative (Nobel prize, Lasker award etc.)


**Setup instructions (step-by-step)**
The process of viewing the website begins with downloading the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Each file must be appropriately named and saved with its respective extension: .html for the HTML file, .css for the CSS file, and .js for the JavaScript file. Additionally, all necessary image assets required for the website should be downloaded and stored in the same folder as the other files. All components, including the index.html file, .css file, .js file, and image files, should be placed in a single directory for proper organization. To view the website, the index.html file can be opened using a web browser, such as Google Chrome, to render the interface as intended. Alternatively, the project directory can be opened in a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, to review and edit the code structure. This approach ensures efficient organization and accessibility of project files, thereby facilitating both development and deployment workflows.
