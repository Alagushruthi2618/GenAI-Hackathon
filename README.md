"Inclusive and Participatory design oriented tool to sustain STEAM education".  
Here is the overview

•	The tool is hyper-personalised based on the learners Intelligence type (There are a total of 8 intelligence types - Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences)

•	Once the intelligence type is identified the learner has to upload their subject material (text book, handwritten notes, sample question paper, other relevant materials)

•	The LLM then proceeds to create a visual output in a storyline format with the learner embedded in the learning experience

•	The tool also creates assessments to ensure spaced repetition based on scoring patterns, forgetting curve, and aims to be scaled up (beyond 15 year olds at both ends of the spectrum) based on John Piaget's theory of cognitive development

•	Intends to develop a healthy and sustained curiosity for STEAM subjects among girls/women by integrating women with noteworthy contributions to society as role models in the narrative (Nobel prize, Lasker award etc.)
