**"Inclusive and Participatory design oriented tool to sustain STEAM education".  Here is the overview**

•	The tool is hyper-personalised based on the learners Intelligence type (There are a total of 8 intelligence types - Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences)

•	Once the intelligence type is identified the learner has to upload their subject material (text book, handwritten notes, sample question paper, other relevant materials)

•	The LLM then proceeds to create a visual output in a storyline format with the learner embedded in the learning experience

•	The tool also creates assessments to ensure spaced repetition based on scoring patterns, forgetting curve, and aims to be scaled up (beyond 15 year olds at both ends of the spectrum) based on John Piaget's theory of cognitive development

•	Intends to develop a healthy and sustained curiosity for STEAM subjects among girls/women by integrating women with noteworthy contributions to society as role models in the narrative (Nobel prize, Lasker award etc.)


**Setup instructions (step-by-step)**

Step 1: Download the Files
Begin by downloading the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files required for the website. Each file should be appropriately named and saved with its respective extension: .html for the HTML file, .css for the CSS file, and .js for the JavaScript file. Ensure the file names are descriptive and relevant to their purpose in the project.

Step 2: Gather the Required Assets
Download all image assets or additional resources used in the website. These files should also be saved in the same directory as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to maintain a simple and efficient project structure.

Step 3: Organize the Files
Create a single folder to store all the components of the website. Place the HTML file, CSS file, JavaScript file, and image assets together in this folder. This organization ensures that all files are accessible from the same directory, allowing the website to function as intended.

Step 4: View the Website
To view the website, open the HTML file (e.g., index.html) in a web browser such as Google Chrome. This action will render the website, allowing you to verify its layout, functionality, and design.

Step 5: Review the Code
For further inspection or editing, open the project folder in a code editor like Visual Studio Code. This tool allows you to view and modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code efficiently while maintaining proper syntax and structure.
